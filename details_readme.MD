To run the code in Google Colab:

1. Upload the `details.csv` file:
   - Click on the "Files" icon on the left-hand side of the Colab interface.
   - Click on the "Upload" button and select the `details.csv` file from your local machine.

2. Run the code cells:
   - Go to the "Runtime" menu at the top of the Colab interface.
   - Select "Run all" to run all the code cells in the notebook.
   - Alternatively, you can run each code cell individually by clicking the play button next to each cell or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.

Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed, such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and any other libraries mentioned in the code. If any library is missing, you can install it using the command `!pip install <library-name>` in a code cell.

For running the `.py` file locally:

1. Place the `details.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script file (`adappt_eda_details.py`).

2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python script file and `details.csv` file are located.

3. Run the following command to execute the Python script:
   ```
   python adappt_eda_details.py
   ```

   Make sure you have Python installed and added to the system's PATH variable.

The code will execute, and you will see the output and visualizations in the console or the Jupyter Notebook interface (make sure you have installed Anaconda packages), depending on the environment you are using.
